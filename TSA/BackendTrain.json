{"Text":{"0":"stuning even for the non gamer  this sound track was beautiful  it paints the senery in your mind so well i would recomend it even to people who hate vid  game music  i have played the game chrono cross but out of all of the games i have ever played it has the best music  it backs away from crude keyboarding and takes a fresher step with grate guitars and soulful orchestras  it would impress anyone who cares to listen   _ ","1":"the best soundtrack ever to anything   i m reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best  game soundtrack  and i figured that i d write a review to disagree a bit  this in my opinino is yasunori mitsuda s ultimate masterpiece  the music is timeless and i m been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade the price tag on this is pretty staggering i must say  but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money  this is the only one that i feel would be worth every penny ","2":"amazing   this soundtrack is my favorite music of all time  hands down  the intense sadness of  prisoners of fate   which means all the more if you ve played the game  and the hope in  a distant promise  and  girl who stole the star  have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years  the higher energy tracks like  chrono cross   time s scar     time of the dreamwatch   and  chronomantique   indefinably remeniscent of chrono trigger  are all absolutely superb as well this soundtrack is amazing music  probably the best of this composer s work  i haven t heard the xenogears soundtrack  so i can t say for sure   and even if you ve never played the game  it would be worth twice the price to buy it i wish i could give it 6 stars ","3":"excellent soundtrack  i truly like this soundtrack and i enjoy video game music  i have played this game and most of the music on here i enjoy and it s truly relaxing and peaceful on disk one  my favorites are scars of time  between life and death  forest of illusion  fortress of ancient dragons  lost fragment  and drowned valley disk two  the draggons  galdorb   home  chronomantique  prisoners of fate  gale  and my girlfriend likes zelbessdisk three  the best of the three  garden of god  chronopolis  fates  jellyfish sea  burning orphange  dragon s prayer  tower of stars  dragon god  and radical dreamers   unstealable jewel overall  this is a excellent soundtrack and should be brought by those that like video game music xander cross","4":"remember  pull your jaw off the floor after hearing it  if you ve played the game  you know how divine the music is  every single song tells a story of the game  it s that good  the greatest songs are without a doubt  chrono cross  time s scar  magical dreamers  the wind  the stars  and the sea and radical dreamers  unstolen jewel   translation varies  this music is perfect if you ask me  the best it can be  yasunori mitsuda just poured his heart on and wrote it down on paper ","5":"an absolute masterpiece  i am quite sure any of you actually taking the time to read this have played the game at least once  and heard at least a few of the tracks here  and whether you were aware of it or not  mitsuda s music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole game composed of 3 cds and quite a few songs  i haven t an exact count   all of which are heart rendering and impressively remarkable  this soundtrack is one i assure you you will not forget  it has everything for every listener    from fast paced and energetic  dancing the tokage or termina home   to slower and more haunting  dragon god   to purely beautifully composed  time s scar   to even some fantastic vocals  radical dreamers  this is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there  and surely mitsuda s best ever   _ ","6":"buyer beware  this is a self published book  and if you want to know why  read a few paragraphs  those 5 star reviews must have been written by ms  haddon s family and friends  or perhaps  by herself  i can t imagine anyone reading the whole thing  i spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another  it is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a  worst book  contest  i can t believe amazon even sells this kind of thing  maybe i can offer them my 8th grade term paper on  to kill a mockingbird   a book i am quite sure ms  haddon never heard of  anyway  unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke   stay far  far away from this one ","7":"glorious story  i loved whisper of the wicked saints  the story was amazing and i was pleasantly surprised at the changes in the book  i am not normaly someone who is into romance novels  but the world was raving about this book and so i bought it  i loved it    this is a brilliant story because it is so true  this book was so wonderful that i have told all of my friends to read it  it is not a typical romance  it is so much more  not reading this book is a crime  becuase you are missing out on a heart warming story ","8":"a five star book  i just finished reading whisper of the wicked saints  i fell in love with the caracters  i expected an average romance read  but instead i found one of my favorite books of all time  just when i thought i could predict the outcome i was shocked   the writting was so descriptive that my heart broke when julia s did and i felt as if i was there with them instead of just a distant reader  if you are a lover of romance novels then this is a must read  don t let the cover fool you this book is spectacular ","9":"whispers of the wicked saints  this was a easy to read book that made me want to keep reading on and on  not easy to put down it left me wanting to read the follow on  which i hope is coming soon  i used to read a lot but have gotten away from it  this book made me want to read again  very enjoyable ","10":"the worst   a complete waste of time  typographical errors  poor grammar  and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing  i m embarrassed for this author and very disappointed i actually paid for this book ","11":"great book  this was a great book i just could not put it down and could not read it fast enough  boy what a book the twist and turns in this just keeps you guessing and wanting to know what is going to happen next  this book makes you fall in love and can heat you up it can also make you so angery  this book can make you go throu several of your emotions  this is a quick read romance  it is something that you will want to end your day off with if you read at night ","12":"great read  i thought this book was brilliant  but yet realistic  it showed me that to error is human  i loved the fact that this writer showed the loving side of god and not the revengeful side of him  i loved how it twisted and turned and i could not put it down  i also loved the glass castle ","13":"oh please  i guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one  and not a very discerning one  all others beware  it is absolute drivel  i figured i was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover  but the first page of the book removed all doubt  wait   maybe i m missing the point  a quick re read of the beginning now makes it clear  this has to be an intentional churning of over heated prose for satiric purposes  phew  so glad i didn t waste  10 95 after all ","14":"awful beyond belief   i feel i have to write to keep others from wasting their money  this book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age  as another reviewer points out  there is a misspelling on the cover  and i believe there is at least one per chapter  for example  it was mentioned twice that she had a  lean  on her house  i was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot  that i decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling  please don t waste your money  i too  believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author s relatives  i will not put much faith in the reviews from now on ","15":"don t try to fool us with fake reviews   it s glaringly obvious that all of the glowing reviews have been written by the same person  perhaps the author herself  they all have the same misspellings and poor sentence structure that is featured in the book  who made veronica haddon think she is an author ","16":"a romantic zen baseball comedy  when you hear folks say that they don t make  em like that anymore  they might be talking about  by the sea   this is a very cool story about a young cuban girl searching for idenity who stumbles into a coastal resort kitchen gig with a zen motorcycle maintenance man  three hysterical italian chefs and a latino fireballing right handed pitcher who plays on the team sponsored by the resort s owner  as is often the case she  finds  herself through honest  often comical but always emotional  interaction with this sizzling roster of players  with the perfect mix of special effects  that salsa sound and flashbacks  by the sea  gets 4 big stars from me ","17":"fashionable compression stockings   after i had a dvt my doctor required me to wear compression stockings  i wore ugly white ted hose and yucky thick brown stockings  then i found jobst ultrasheer  they gave me the compression i needed  15 20   but looked like regular pantyhose  even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years  i still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice   note  i have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh  i tried the jobst adhesive  but i hated having my skin pulled all day  i bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling ","18":"jobst ultrasheer thigh high  excellent product  however  they are very difficult to get on for older people  i feel like i ve had a full day workout after getting them on  also  as the day wears on  they begin to roll down from the top and create a very deep ridge in the skin  i have to wear them  so if those two difficulties could be addressed it would be such a help ","19":"sizes recomended in the size chart are not real  sizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart  i tried to put it and sheer it   i guess you should not buy this item in the internet  it is better to go to the store and check it","20":"mens ultrasheer  this model may be ok for sedentary types  but i m active and get around alot in my job   consistently found these stockings rolled up down by my ankles  not good   solution  go with the standard compression stocking  20 30  stock  114622  excellent support  stays up and gives me what i need  both pair of these also tore as i struggled to pull them up all the time  good riddance bad investment ","21":"delicious cookie mix  i thought it was funny that i bought this product without knowing it was a mix  i read the header very quickly and just thought it was packaged cookies  but no  it is cookie mix and i guess i should have noticed that since it is right in the title this is the first time i have ever tried baking with a cookie mix  if you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise  mixing up the dough can get very messy  it is extremely sticky   however  with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients  i like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy   also  this mix has really large chocolate chips in it  i love that i removed a star for the addition of  natural flavors  in the mix ","22":"another abysmal digital copy  rather than scratches and insect droppings  this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution  probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer if you ve ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy  you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white  the surrounding countryside and  old home  scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright  clear  and immediate here everything is dull  dark  and clouded  or  if you remember the timbre and enunciation of captain s commands  so are the visuals after that  it is hard to believe this award winning  critically acclaimed film s best presentation is on youtube  somewhere  out there  is a dvd that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel just none of them appear to be on amazon ","23":"a fascinating insight into the life of modern japanese teens  i thoroughly enjoyed rising sons and daughters  i don t know of any other book that looks at japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents  age old japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community  and their peers  adulation of western culture  true to form  the  new young  of japan seem to be creating an  international  blend  as the ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family  steven wardell is clearly a talented young author  adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens  and thus able to view family life in japan from the inside out  a great read ","24":"i liked this album more then i thought i would  i heard a song or two and thought same o same o but when i listened to songs like  blue angel   lanna  and  mama  the hair just rose off my neck roy is trully an amazing singer with a talent you don t find much now days ","25":"problem with charging smaller aaas  i have had the charger for more than two years  it charges aa batteries just fine  but has a huge problem securing smaller aaa batteries  to charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end  in the beginning one of the four aaa batteries would pop up  and now three out of the four won t hold  the problem is the flip mechanism became loose  and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up  what i have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon  apply the crayon on the buttons  and wrap the tape around  you know how painful that is ","26":"works  but not as advertised  i bought one of these chargers  the instructions say the lights stay on while the battery charges   true  the instructions dont say the lights turn off when its done  which is also true  24 hours of charging and the lights stay on  i returned it thinking i had a bad unit the new one did the same thing  i just kept it since it does charge   but the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on  it s a  backup  charger for when i manage to drain all my aas but i wouldn t want this as my only charger ","27":"disappointed  i read the reviews made my purchase and was very disappointed  the charger is convenient by charging all four batteries at once but the charge only lasts a very short time  i now have to go and find batteries that will give me longer life than the kodak nimh aa batteries ","28":"oh dear  i was excited to find a book ostensibly about muslim feminism  but this volume did not live up to the expectations one essay  among other things  describes the veil as potentially liberating  it doesn t begin to explain how or why another  on muslim women in cape town  claims that muslim women there are separate but  more than equal   gee whiz  what a disappointment i had expected and hoped for at least one muslim feminist condemnation of gender apartheid  but there is not a single one in the book i m surprised it didn t have an essay extolling the virtues of female genital mutilation   alyssa a  lappen","29":"based on the reviews here i bought one and i m glad i did   this vcr dvd was an early christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in dvd land but not wanting to let go of my vhs movies quite yet  based on the reviews and price  and because i own a jvc tv  this was my choice  i agree with the easy set up  it s a bit awkward to work the whole tv vhs dvd selection options but i think i ve gotten the hang of it two comments  it s not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated  too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically minded than me  so i ve had to rely heavily on the how to manual  and setting the vcr timer is awkward    you can t enter the start and end time but have to scroll  unless i m missing something    but those are my only complaints  this is a good product for your     ","30":"incorrect disc   i am a big jvc fan  but i do not like this model  i was suspiscious when i saw several units in the return section of the store  i bought one anyway  new  and must say i am not happy  the unit sends out clicks to the receiver once in a while  the transition between scenes is not always smooth  like a little pause  and while it is still fairly new i can t get any dvd cd or even a dvd headcleaner to work  all i get is a  incorrect disc  message ","31":"happy with it   but  i m a jvc nut   i have 3 jvc televisions  one vcr  one bookshelf audio system and car audio system  so when it came time to move the vcr player to the boys room and get another one for the old man i knew what make it was going to be  i decided on the combo player because i don t think vhs is going to be around much longer  i like my combo player except for 2 things  1 no cable box compatability on the remote control  2 no seperate audio video inputs only input for coax cable from my cable box so all of the cable programming is in mono   wife can t tell the difference in the sound so if she s happy then i ll just live with it  vcr and dvd look and sound great       ","32":"should be titled  hollywood debacle   the plot is so ridiculous  i have to wonder if they even read the script before making this film  the mountain lion breaks out of his trailer   and the cars behind don t notice  the mountain lion is captured   and put in a jail cell  get real  utterly  completely stupid ","33":"is this great tv    you bet it is  hotel babylon is not just good tv   it s great tv     the show features some incredible acting from tamzin outhwaite  formerly of eastenders  a bbc soap  and max beesley  from the ill fated movie  glitter  starring mariah carey   the show could make for a great drama series  but i felt that it is a mix of a drama  comedy  and soap opera all mixed into a great bbc show  the show aired on bbc america for a while but didn t get around to seeing it  i can now say that i got the dvd set and all the episodes are great  the season finale was an interesting to watch the show reminds me of hotel which aired on abc from 1983 to 1988  the reason   hotel was set at a fictional san francisco hotel as hotel babylon was set at a luxury five star hotel in england i recommend this dvd to anyone who is willing to watch a great show from the bbc ","34":"nothing you don t already know  if you have even casually looked into applying to law school  have already read everything there is in this book  do not waste your money  seriously  ","35":"unfortunately it wasn t entertaining in the least bit   when i first ordered the cd  i figured it was going to be a hip  cool daddy vibe cd  however much to my dismay it sounds like a fourth grade music class  the main jist of the cd is that there is a xylaphone playing over peoples voices trying to replicate happening party  i believe if i played this cd at a party anywhere in my neighborhood i would get laughed off the beach  growing up a surfer in san diego  i would not recommend this cd to any of my southern california brothers  honestly  when i played it i kinda of felt i was in a bad b movie  the absolutle epitimy of the cd is the last  vibe  surf cha cha  surfers don t cha ","36":"rochelle explains it all for you  wondering what the hell has happened to the moral aspect of modern american culture   this book is a lucid  well argued explanation of the simple fact that we have become so totally focused on our individual rights that we have completely ignored  and even mocked  our personal and public responsibilities  the final response and indictment of robert ringer s best seller  looking out for  1  this is a great time for anyone who is disgusted with the boorish state of american media  politics and discourse in general  to clear their heads for the substantial challenges that lie before us not only as americans  but as human beings  a great book","37":"more great playing  larry s work for the muse label in the late 80s and early 90s found him exploring the rich catalog of jazz standards that he probably grew up playing  surrounding himself with the best musicians around  larry sounds relaxed  focused  and totally in control  listen to larry s take on  my funny valentine  and tell me it doesn t stand right up there with chet baker s or miles   a very fine album that you ll enjoy again and again ","38":"doesn t work on a mac  it clearly says on line this will work on a mac os system  the disk comes and it does not  only windows   do not order this if you have a mac       ","39":"very frustrating  my three year old son was very excited to get this but after two attempts at playing it hasn t been touched since  you are not able to use the mouse through any of the games except for the  power up segments  instead you are using the up down arrows on the keyboard   too hard for him and not much fun  very disapointed with this game and wish i could return it ","40":"mind numbing  this game makes you do the same things over and over  it never holds my son s attention long enough to get to the next level  there is no choice of games you have to do every thing in order  we have another rescue heroes game and both my boys 3 and 6 love it  but this one is a dog ","41":"cannot recommend  as a former alaskan  i didn t want to have to do this  but after repeatedly attempting allman s recipes and having to throw out 8 10 cups of flour and miscellaneous ingredients nearly every time  and then comparing to ed wood s recipes which work flawlessly  and lisa rayner s very excellent wild bread  hand baked sourdough artisan breads in your own kitchen  i can t help but notice that their recipes work  where allman s fail i m not a novice baker  the only thing that worked reliably was the pancakes recipe  but that can be found other places as well if you are looking for reliable recipes and concise information about starting a sourdough and maintaining it  i recommend any of ed wood s books  even his very old ones  lisa rayner has written a fabulous tome in wild bread  but pass on this book while some of the historical vignettes were interesting  not enough so to warrant the cost of the book  check it out at your library if you must ","42":"alaska sourdough  read most of the book while visiting my brother in alaska  loved it  i am going to be making my sourdough starter soon  book is full of great stories and recipes ","43":"old and good  this book is worth to keep in your collection as it does not only advise what to do with sourdough but ruth also told you what the picture of past 100 years ago in alaska where no stand mixer nor any civilized stuffs in kitchen  just a pot of sourdough ","44":"autumn  got this for my daughter in nc  she is now making prefect bread  wish she lived closer to make me some","45":"fast mp3 download of music waxed decades ago  one of these 26 songs played as background music on a youtube video of some kind of gymnastic or dance feat out of russia  i hunted down the melody  read the english lyrics  then decided to see what else was in the album  downloaded the full album for  15 via amazon mp3 downloader  and now happily listen to the melodies  interspersed  on my ipod ","46":"maybe i got a bad one   my experience  i got this from fm  not amazon  the dvd player rattled pretty loudly sometimes  but not always  when i put in a dvd  i tried several  the picture quality wasn t all that great and the screen got a horizontal line thru the middle after a short time that would not go away  plus one of the other reviewers was dead on about the remote   the layout makes no sense at all  very poor human engineering  imo  i brought it back to the store for a refund  i saw the same model under the emerson name for   400 at wm but was hesitant to buy it ","47":"sylvania 6620ldg 20  flat panel lcd tv with built in dvd player  light weight  space saving very attractive design  sharp picture  good sound quality and quick response time  dvd playback also excellent  only negative is its remote control  it is hard to read the functions of the keys due to color choices  the placement of the keys are almost illogical and you have to look at it carefully before each use  it almost seems like it was designed by an imbecil  the quality  the features and the price still makes this tv an excellent buy ","48":"terrible   do not buy this  i bought this for my wife for her birthday and had toreturn it because the dvd palyer would not work  i returned it and got a repalcement  which once again the dvd player failed to work  it is a piece of junk ","49":"    beware      this tv is set so that it is not capable of a  recall  function  if you want to flash back between channels  this tv is not going to give it to you  the remote control that comes with the tv has no recall function  so i bought a sony universal  which is a much better remote  that had the recall button on it  however  i soon learned that the tv is set at the factory to not have the capability to flash back  it may not be a big deal to some  but this user found it very annoying ","50":"kitchen tv  i bought this to replace a 13  tube tv in my kitchen  what i gained was a larger screen plus relcaiming the counter space  the picture is good  and the internal dvd player is a bonus  all in all  a good purchase ","51":"nice for the money  the first one i bought was defective  the dvd didn t work at all  i purchased it from electronics express and when i contacted them they were wonderful  they gave me an rma number right away  fedex picked it up the next day and a new one arrived 1 week later  this one is just fine  i really love the clarity of the picture  my only complaint is that in dvd mode  the sound isn t loud enough  i have it in my rv and with the a c running  i can barely hear it  i solved the problem by running an audio out jack from the tv to the input on the rv stereo speaker system  it s very lightweight and easy to move around and store  a bonus for the rv  the remote isn t great  but it works just fine and the video audio jacks and antenna input are easy to get to as is the dvd player  all in all  it s a great deal for the price ","52":"disappointed romanian   this book in my opinion is biased and takes an angle of europe that is  clean and proper  and fails to shed light on the rest of it  i can understand that these are  tourist guides  and why would anyone want to tour a country forgotten by time  however  i am a very disappointed romanian with this book and would never use it as my reference  i have seen travel guides outlining europe exclude romania before  but with the precision and detail of dk s series  i was left yet again in disappointment ","53":"great travel guide to europe   this book is realy great for everybody who likes to travel europe  the combination of good pictures  illustration and texts is perfect  you get a good overall view for the most important sights  places  cities and countries in europe and also a bit of historical information  as a european who already traveled a bit i still could find a lot of inspiration to more interesting places to go  thank a lot to eyewitness travel for there great books ","54":"not the best  i bought both this and lonely planet and have used lonely planet more because this book is full of pictures but doesn t give you all the info you need  also  i ended up buying each indiv city guide as well because this one only scratches the surface ","55":"good but received defective book  i bought this book because we are moving to germany and i wanted to get a good overview of all the countries in europe that we could travel too  unfortunately pages 457 480 on greece are not in english   looks to be spanish  there was some sort of printing problem  but i found the rest of the book to give good highlights of the countries ","56":"from the label   from memphis  tn  comes the reatards  fronted  of course  by wild kid jay reatard  he starting off on eric oblivians label  goner  at the tender age of 15  jay  now 19  is still rocking and offending the sensibilities of his community  overdriven  loud  crackling guitars underlaying jay s southern crooning howl energizes some of the most amazing hate filled song writing we ve heard in years ","57":"either 1 or 5 stars  depends on how you look at it   either 1 or 5 stars  depends on how you look at it 1 star because they sent 6 feet of 2  od copper pipe 0 star because they won t accept returns on it 5 stars because i figure it s actually worth  12 15 foot and since they won t take a return i figure i can sell it and make  40 50 on this deal","58":"hunting the hard way  thia was a gift for my husband  who loved the book  it arrived on the date we were told it would ","59":"disappointing  the text is the same as ever  i think   but the plates are markedly inferior to all previous editions  had i known this ahead of time  i would not have purchased this volume ","60":"homer or moses   an extremely helpful gem on a complex subject of second century religious authority and textual use  for anyone serious about this period and the interelation of cultures  this book is essential  is it complex and detailed  of course  it must be to argue the point  should you buy it  yes  unless you want to keep running back to the library  i write this only after thoroughly disagreeing with the review above ","61":"very poor quality   the screen arrived in a cardboard box that was pretty beat up  the screen itself is very lightweight  very cheesy looking  the  finish  was worn across the entire top of the screen  i knew this wasn t solid brass  but i expected something that at least looked decent from a distance for the price i paid ","62":"scraped across the whole top   purchased this screen last week and it came with noticeable scrapes across the top  the box it came in was gigantic with plenty of packaging material  but the screen was packaged loosely at the bottom  however  since it was in another smaller box  i m thinking that the scraping was there to begin with  and not from shipping  still deciding whether to go through the trouble of exchanging it since another reviewer said they had the same damage  i wouldn t want to risk getting another with the same damage and i really need a screen right now  other than the damage  it s a very nice screen ","63":"unknown africa  you don t expect music from africa to be so profesionally produced  me from the white world  don t understand the lyrics  but we do understand the music which is a mixture between salsa  soukous and fado with always the african feeling for rithem  the soft almost borred voice of oliver n goma fits pefectly in the music  the cd is recorded in france paris  you can hear that professionals have been working on the cd  a must for a hot  lazy night greetings arno  amsterdam","64":"didn t live up to expectations   i ordered these shoes to replace the previous pair that had ripped apart at the sole  clark said they did not make this shoe anymore  so i had to order them through amazon  sadly  the second pair ripped in the same place within 3 months  my son has since bought a similar pair from sperry and they seem to be holding up much better ","65":"profound then  truly horrible now   the narrative style of this work by famous founders  biographer john morse is arrogant  flippant and frequently exaggerated  it carries the tone of the amateur yankee historian on high  passing judgment on this southern statesman who was neither from boston nor a harvard graduate  perhaps considered penetrating for its day  it really represents nothing more than opinion today  the research is so thin that one must conclude that morse wrote the entire manuscript essentially from memory  with little reference to the primary and secondary sources we expect of historians now  if it weren t for the fact that morse wrote this piece 110 years ago  i d have rated it only one star ","66":"definitely enjoyed   this was a gift for my 6 yr old daughter  she is a big barbie fan as well as loves to use the computer  she is still enjoying this game  she completed it in a few hours which worried me at first  but she loves to do it over and over again  the music is enjoyable and the colors are vibrant  it seems to be very user friendly also    my daughter has not really needed my help to use it once she started it the first time ","67":"even mommy has fun with this one   my four year old daughter loves everything barbie and loves the rapunzel movie  this game is tons of fun  even for a 42 year old  we love playing it together  we love decorating all the rooms and finding the gems  what even better is  she can play it alone and i get some me time ","68":"great combination of creativity and adventure  my 4 year old daughter has been addicted to this game  she plays it over and over again  she loves the opening song and has been singing it non stop  she gets excited each time she completes a room and finds a gem and loves solving the maze to find prince stefan  the only problem is that she sings the song so much i can t get it out of my head ","69":"rapunzel  this is such a great game both my 3 year old son and 7 year old daughter love it  i like to play to if they would let me  so much fun decorating the rooms and so many choices to keep you playing great game  not at all what you would think a barbie game would be  great fun for all  ","70":" not what i expected       my daughter and i loved the movie  she is 5 years old and it took her 2 hours to complete the game  absolutely no challenge  and very little interaction  it is essentially just clicking on the screen to make it play the 7 or 8 scenes it has programmed  there are no games to play  nothing to figure out  nothing to do  save your money ","71":"barbie rapunzel   crying child  my 6 year old daughter is currently sobbing in her bedroom as a result of this rotten game she spent an hour on this game painting in pretty pictures and coloring in flowers  but halfway through the game  the program hung  and wouldn t let us leave the room or click anywhere else  now even if we exit the game and then start it back up  we are frozen in one spot while barbie s disembodied voice urges us to  explore somewhere else in the castle  standard software troubleshooting and rebooting didn t help  vivendi games  support site is  currently disabled   and now i m left with a weeping  frustrating child who doesn t understand that it is not her fault that her game won t work  i m hoping it was just incompetent software programming that couldn t catch the bug my 6 year old caught the first time around  or maybe they just don t care about the problems  so long as you get our 20 bucks  if you don t want a crying little girl  avoid this game ","72":"barbie as rapunzel  a creative adventure  i purchased this software for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves playing it so much  she lets me play it sometimes  but she doesn t always like what i come up with  i plan to purchase other software programs for her ","73":"use your imagination   my 3 year old daughter   i both love this software  we actually fight over who is going paint the pictures or choose the themes for each room  this game allows you to be creative   use your imagination by  decorating  each room of the castle and finding the missing gems to the prince s crown which gives rapunzel the power to find prince stephan who has been turned to stone   bring him back to life  the music   animation is the best i have seen  most of the kids software that i ve seen is boring to me as an adult  but this is not at all  i sometimes like to play it without her  there are so many variations on color schemes   patterns   that you can never be bored  i highly recommend this for girls of all ages ","74":"not so good   ok for a rental   this game is pretty exciting and it is very nice and it is really creative and one of a kind  the only bad thing is that there is only one  castle  for the kids to  decorate  and once you are done with the whole castle that is basically it  you either have to create a new username for yourself to do it all over again or you get another game like i did  my sister finished the  castle  in about 2 hours and after that has never even looked at this game anymore  it is a nice game and it is fun but it is not really worth that much money ","75":"not os x but mac classic  negative  this game does not work with os x and requires the cd so you can t have it on multiple computers  it is slow i have to tell my daughter that it is thinking a lot  this is because it has to access the cd everytime there is a new task  you can t view the openning sequence again without throwing out the saved game files  some of the tasks and controls are too hard and not user friendly even for adults it crashes all the time mouse is jumpy and hard to use positive  some tasks are easy  possible to use  grand and beautiful my three year has enough patience to survive the multiple trials to get this to work ","76":"bad deal    i ordered this dvd and received a substitute i never received the dvd i ordered from importcds  the vendor   i contacted them and did not recieve any feedback  i can t rate a dvd i have never seen  i didn t bother to send it back because it would have cost me more that i orginally paid for it  in the future i will watch for the name of the person and or persons i am buying from  i thought they were a good company  i understand a simple mistake but  to not get a response at all is not good businees sense  i spend hundreds of dollars a month on amazon com building my dvd collection  i guess i will be more careful in the future ","77":"smells divine   this is my second bottle of sheer freesia  i just love this fragrance  its a light delicate sent  beautiful  like a summer day ","78":"very disappointed   this perfume is just awful  smells nothing like freesia the gift recipient was not impressed  the worst is that it can t be returned ","79":"creepy  wow  what people will do behind jealousy and revenge   there are some doors you should not open  and if you do   be prepared for what you find behind it ","80":"audio options non existent  while the movie in itself was better than i expected what i didnt expect was the  non existent  thai soundtrack  while the option was on the disc menu  as well as stated on the package  the thai soundtrack does not exist  no matter what you choose  thai or english  english is what you get and while there are some exceptions most dubbing is ridiculous at best and the dubbing on this title is sub par  while this review covers only the first movie of the two the other may remain in plastic never to see the inside of my dvd player  its a shame and a sham when you purchase what claims to be original and is not  very disapointed in this offering from tokyo shock ","81":"sooo jammin   too trill  man  some more jammin tracks from the suc  this is pokey s first official record    and sh   is sooo real  love the production  everything is real nice   screwed out  this is among the last of the great suc records  not to say they ve fallen off    just they ve

this is how a southside cd should always be ","83":"good book  well written chronicles of the farm from the people who lived it  excellent photos as well i kept looking for a photo of me and my then

at the seller s feedback   i m not the only person they have done wrong  so buyer beware  ","89":"ariel litte mermaid with pearl kit  arrived very quickly and it is a cute topper however i wouldn t have bought it if they didn t provide instructions     i should have listened to the other reviews     if you are hoping to get more than the topper do not buy this   so annoyed i have this ariel and have no idea how to decorate the cake ","90":"no instructions included   do not trust seller  promised with this item are  complete instructions  and the additional pledge that  sweet graces will email you with the supply list and instruction sheets on purchase   so you can be ready ahead of time   i received none of this   only a plastic figurine and bracelet  to boot  amazon claims they can do nothing to help me contact the seller  all i got was a phone number for the manufacturer  let s hope that yields some results  meanwhile  i m wishing i had listened to previous feedback about this unreliable seller   ","91":"why is soulwax ignored by critics   consumers alike    i just don t get it   soulwax has been around since the 90s  when they released their  rock  debut  on the now defunct almo sounds   chock full of should have been radio hits  and then when while they got some attention for their  2 many djs  mash up remix bootlegs  when they return to a full fledged band  as with last year s any minute now  critcs   consumers alike barely took notice of that album s amazing writing  production  and sheer electro rock power  hopefully   nite versions   a cheeky title recalling when 80s bands like duran duran used to release  nite version  on 12  of singles for clubs  will garner more sales and attention for soulwax   the songs practically leap out of the speakers to grab your neck and turn you head and make you move  can t wait to hear what they do tiga on his upcoming  sexor  debut    ","92":"omg soulwax owns  wow   this is like the most amazing album ever  every track so rocks   specially1  e talking2  nylipps3  i love techo great job guysmusicchoice played their whole album this saturday night  and i was jamming to it the whole time going  wow  one more thing  if you re not into house techno electronic then you don t want none of this  cause you won t feel it ","93":"slow dull  classical  1980 s style movie  2 stars of 5 for this slow dull  classical  1980 s style movie  this movie has a young jason bateman in the lead  very very very slow and dull with a few moments of bad 1980 s style music  to our relief the background music  which is very annoying  is kept to a minimum  though it attempts to be an action suspense movie  it achieves neither  i d suggest skipping this movie ","94":"thank you for releasing it       i loved this movie as a kid and i am so happy the powers that be have decided to release it finally  if you want to see a great 80 s movie  this is it ","95":"very not worth your time  the book was wriiten very horribly  i would never in my life recommend such a book  the stories lacked any mystery to them and did not leave me wanting to figure out who the culprit was  the only good thing was that none of the stories took up ten or twelve pages ","96":"very fun and educational  trains  shapes and pegs   a winning combination  guaranteed to make both the child and the parent happy  good starter puzzle for the 1 yr old range ","97":"ludicrous and silly  i remember getting this book so faintly that that says alot about my opinion of it  basically  while i will entertain lots of odd ideas and theories  this book was basically silly ","98":"artistry  i think that the deodato concerts are very rich  as he used real strings and band musicians  as well as you can appreciate the john tropea excelent renditions on guitar ","99":"caution   these tracks are not the  original  versions but are re recorded versions  so  whether the tracks are  remastered  or not is irrelevant ","100":"textbook  book shipped quickly and was in excellent condition as stated  easy transaction would buy again","101":"a great book for historical romance lovers  this is an engaging a count of life of tess a girl who at a young age washed up on the shore of the isle of may  with no memory of the life before then  she stays with the old caretakers of the isle  after the caretakers are dead a young man  colin macpherson washes up on shore  colin takes tess back with her to his castle where he helps her uncover her past  they are opposites but you know what they say opposites attract  this book is just one of many in the avon true romance series  i have read every book in the series and i know that if you like this book you love the rest  this is a great book for girls about 10 to 16 because it is still a romance novel  but not what you call a trashy romance novel  it is a great novel fokr those who are just getting into romance novels ","102":"yes     when i got this book  i wasn t expecting much  but man was i wrong  i loved this book  now i may not usually be tied in by a man with long blond hair wearing a kilt  but the authors really made colin into this enchanting highlander  tess is a very soft heroine  while she sometimes seems too guillible  i have to remember that it is part of the story  this is one of my favorite books in the series ","103":"not the best in the series  tess lindsay is content to be the sole occupant of a remote island but when colin macpherson washes ashore her life of solitude gets shaken up  tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with colin  soon tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new life the beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem  the plot loses much of it s believability mostly due to the poor characterization  all of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason  even tess and colin s development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced  the writing does improve towards the end but it s not enough to save the book  unless you have your heart set on reading all of the books in the series  skip this one ","104":"addonics portable cd drive   i am disappointed in its performance  i am disappointed in its performance  it seems underpowered and is constantly trying to read cds  half the time unsuccessfully  i am going to try to return it to amazon ","105":"too uncomfortable and too big  these pants were way too big  looked about 2 sizes larger   and they were incredibly stiff  they would have been very uncomfortable for my daughter to wear all day ","106":"very authentic  this is my first encounter with yoruba and i have to say that cds are really helping  however  the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances   for someone who never spoke yoruba and doesn t have anybody to ask for a clue  it leaves a lot of questions unanswered   for this  however  there are hopefully other yoruba textbooks on the brighter note  i would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on yoruba people and yoruba culture in general  i would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn yoruba   you can t go wrong with it ","107":"not the best  i agree  the cds are a much needed help  since it would be impossible to pronnounce the yoruba tones without the help of a native speaker  however  the design of the book is really poor and confusing  i have found several spealling mistakes in english and yoruba  and the grammar explanations are very hard to understand unfortunately there are not many teach yourself yoruba books that are worth it  this one at least provides basic vocabulary and pronounciation skills ","108":"doesn t fit  i ordered

nails  etc    and decorate the floats   all by herself  she ll get everything ready  showing me everything she has accomplished along the way  and then we ll watch her special parade  a wonderfully cute game that i highly recommend she can mostly do the entire game on her own  i have it installed on a laptop so she is actually using the inset mouse and can still do the game  the only one she has a tough time with is the polar bear catching fish game  it s tricky to move your finger on the mouse pad and click at the same time to catch the fish  it would be much easier using a regular mouse ","111":"loads of fun   my 6 year old and 5 year old both really enjoy this game  has lots to do with several different animals to prepare for the parade  you get to design a float and it just endless fun  graphics and animation are very colorful and cute  it s a winner ","112":"easy and fun for 3 4yr olds  fun easy game if you can keep it from freezing  i ve reinstalled it and done everything i know to do to correct the issue  it s a shame my 4yr old really likes it ","113":"hours of fun for my 4 and 6 year olds  we purchased this game a year ago and my girls still love to play it  lot s of

lacking in decent tracks  many are jungle y and are difficult to dance to them  also  most of these tracks are unheard of here and are therefore not very enjoyable  however  my favourite are keep on moving  make a jam  and video killed the radio star  but it gets a bit pedantic if you keep playing on these tracks  if anyone is in the same situation as i am  or those of you who are lucky enough

 had that been the only good track on this cd i still would have felt that it was worth my money but the title track is just the beginning for this fine country offering by john michael montgomery  i found myself listening to and enjoying every track on letters from home  montgomery s smoother than silk voice is one of the finest in country music today and his straight forward approach to his music comes through in every note  you won t want to miss this one the horseman","120":"worth the wait   jmm has never released a bad album  many would say this is a comeback album but every couple of years he releases an album with great hits  for some reason  radio hasn t played some of his great songs from his latest albums   goes good with beer  and  little devil  would be great singles to spice up country radio   letters from home  deserves to be single of the year and  cool  is not far behind  the more i listen to the album  the more i love it ","121":"letters from home  i like

was hooked  it is an excellent breakfast choice  or just any time to eat  especially as breakfast because you will crave more honey taste and you won t be hungry later  probably because of how much you d eat  and it is actually sweeter and better than honey bunches of oats  cap n crunch berries is an option  but this splendid cereal is so filled with a honey filled taste  i have not tried much better tasting cereal than this  oh ","125":"delicious and addictive  this cereal is great because it tastes so good  you just crave it  but a word of warning  read the label  last time my husband and

doing anything when we placed them in  hot  water  we searched the internet and found others having the same problem  the instructions are very poor  first off  you need to dip in boiling water  or at least some temperature level above what i would call hot   second  the instructions don t describe what should happen  should the image shrink around the egg  transfer to it    what needless to say  it was frustrating for a minute or two  but my wife   who is very intelligent and great in the kitchen   immediately thought   well    hot water wouldn t do much to change the properties of the

make this stuff up ","146":"as bad a production as possible  this broadway theatre archive production took one of the wittiest  most sparkling 18th century comedies  and ruined it  the costumes are intentionally absurd  think beach blanket babylon   the acting is way over the top camp  and the incidental music could not be worse  the music  btw  is a combination of pop renaissance and pop modern  anything but 18th century  the director appears to have had the goal of showing that his company was just too hip and too modern to do anything but make fun of this silly  fusty old play i like  the school for scandal  very much  and not having found any other dvds of it  i started out with the intention of keeping a recording of even a bad production  but when they got into the extended bop be

performed by the original artists  instead  they re poorly covered by  the starlite singers  ","150":"new wave 80s  i should have read the prior reviews of this record before buying it  although it appears to be a collection of new wave singles from the 80s  these are just cover versions sung by the  starlite singers   the description of the record says that it is by  various artists  implying that they are by the original artists  but this is not true  total garbage  the one bright spot is that i got a prompt refund when i returned it ","151":"don t be fooled   i bought this set last november and just now decided to listen to the cds  nowhere in the description on amazon does it say not the original artists  in fact  it says various artists  which is deceiving because only one group performs all the songs  it leads one to believe original artists when it says various artists because it is  after all  a compilation of music by various artists  duh  so  don t waste your money  i will probably throw these in the trash as i m a purist and i want original  not wedding reception music ","152":"buyers beware           this is one of those cheesy compilations where they find session bands and similar sounding artists to sing the songs  these are not original songs by the artists  if you loved k tel cd s and don t care about hearing the artists originals  and don t care about cheap sounding synthesizers playing the music or that fact that some of the vocalists are pretty bad  then you might like this cd  but if you are a fan of the 80 s and the amazing music it produced  then buy other collections and don t waste your money on this schlock    ","153":"sony basic hi8 handycam rocks   performance is outstanding  i had a previous sony 8 mm handycam which died and i replaced it with this camera so i could continue to playback my old 8 mm tapes  this camera performs faster and is simpler to use than my old sony  it does everything i need and does it well    i got a great deal ","154":"beware    bought this camera for christmas  had her open it first so she could film the nights party   no tapes are included  of course all stores are closed christmas day so the thing is useless until the day after  shame on sony  how much would a tape included in the packace cost them   not included battery chargers are     ","155":"80 s high tech with rock emotion  although all of mr hines work is high quality  waving not drowning  for me  is the highlight of the 3 a m projects  the song  curious kind  is simply a masterpiece the remastering is of the quality you have come to expect from one of rock s greatest producers  song writers  and performers get it ","156":"never gets going  this book never really seems to get going  there is too much time spent in the courtroom while basic questions about the crime and the suspect defendant are left unasked after 200 pages  i realized that this book wasn t going to pick up or reveal any crucial information to make sense out of things until the very end as a result  the whole story rapped up very quickly in an unbelievable way and you are left wondering why no one could figure anything out earlier  based on the ending  the detectives and attorneys appear rather incompetent i did enjoy parts of the book  however  and i think the plot needs to be unfolded at a different rate  not so slow in the beginning and not so fast at the end   i am a mcbain fan and think that some of his other books are better written ","157":"now  the rest of the story  i knew there was something missing from the first book when i read it  because it didn t match what i heard her say years ago when she came to my church to speak  now i know  the abuse was so difficult for her to talk about even when she wrote a book about it  later  with the help of a trusted friend  she was able to tell the most difficult and abusive parts of her childhood experience  this what the second book is about  the most wonderful thing about dorie  is that she is able to forgive her abusers and move on with her life  she is still able to have a successful and happy life  in spite of the horrendous abuse of her childhood  this is what so many women need to hear  with the lord s help  it is possible ","158":"the baseball benchmark  i didn t refer to baseball america as such  it was cardinals gm walt jocketty who said it  and who am i to contradict  the best columnists in the game  from peter gammons  tracy ringolsby and jayson stark  to detailed information in all of baseball  from the major leagues to japan  stats  scores  and the best and most extensive resource on prospect information  there s not a single serious fan in all of baseball who deserves such a title if is not a baseball america subscriber  you got to read it if you want to know the stars of tomorrow  being tomorrow 6 years or 2 months   top 10 prospects from every team till its massive top 100 list  baseball america covers it all  i know  i have been subscribed for 2 years now  and i can t think of living without it ","159":"perfect for the die hard baseball fan  i have read baseball america off and on over the years and finally took the plunge and got a subscription  this is the best place to get coverage of the minors  college  and high school baseball so you know about the top prospects before others do ","160":" uh oh he s been using brand x   an embarassment  steer clear of this one folks  just when you thought these guys were the last real  fusion  types about   since when did the last great secret of the fusion world

 and well does one really want those ","161":"this was an intriguing book that influenced my destiny   i read  trouble on titan  around 1970  when the apollo program was at its apex  and the human exploration of the solar system seemed only a short step away  my review is based on old memories  but i can still remember a mining colony on titan and jet craft using oxygen for fuel and burning titan s methane atmosphere  we ve learned much since this book was written  and titan s atmosphere has less methane than we originally thought  however  this book was well written  and i am sure will intrigue my son as much as it intrigued his father  who is now working at nasa on the cassini huygens mission to saturn and titan  this book has that old style sci fi flavor that made another world seem more like reality than fantasy  i think if you enjoyed the lucky starr and david starr stories by asimov  you will enjoy  trouble on titan  ","162":"peek a fun   we got these as a gift for our one year old  he loves them  he tries very hard to get all the little things out of the blocks   and obviously fails  he loves that some of them move  some of them jiggle  some of them make noise   its almost an adventure the three year old also loves them because they incorporate the alphabet and he can easily identify the items inside  b   banana  p   penguin  u   umbrella  z   zebra bonus   when the 1 y o gets frustrated because he can t pry the items out of the block no matter how hard he tries  he usually flings them  the 3 y o tends to use them to build walls or towers for the sole purpose of smashing another toy into them  or dropping them off high places  and i ve stepped on two of them already  they seem to tolerate this treatment rather well ","163":"excellent product  these alphabet blocks are so beautiful they could be classed as works of art or collectors items  i have purchased two seys as gifts and will probably buy more ","164":"great for twins  i purchased the alphabet blocks for my twin daughters  they are just over 8 months old and they love them  this product is a great learning tool for them for years to come but for now it a great teething toy    i would recommend this to anyone  plus i love fisher price ","165":"they re blocks   keep that in mind  we got these after seeing the incrediblocks in the fp catalog there are little to no pizazz to the blocks  some have features where you can  spin  them  like the letter q   queen  or the w  watermelon seeds that rattle    but most are just a  look at me  type of a block with that in mind   yes i like the product  they re blocks  they re meant for stacking  knocking over and banging   which my son loves  he s had these since he was 6 months   they re better than the plain wooden blocks because they re textured  they have objects inside  letters   lots of opportunities to learn letters  colors  objects  descriptions  etc for now he s stacking  banging and knocking over  it ll be around for a while until he s ready to learn more words  colors  objects  animals  this review isn t profound or eye openings because again   they re just blocks  keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision  it will not make your child an overnight rocket scientist   ","166":"would have expected better   i bought these for two reasons  blocks and educational letters  however  the letters are rubbing off  for the price i paid that was dissapointing  other than that i love the concept and the objects inside are fun ","167":"cute gift for a little baby  although i felt it looked a bit chinsy  the mother had it on her wish list and was very happy to receive them ","168":"great blocks  my daughter loves her blocks  she will get them all out and look at each one until she finds her favorite  she likes to shake them and see what each one does  these are cute little blocks that have hours of imaginative playtime inside  they also have blunt corners  so no sharp edges like wood blocks for the safety of smaller children  the fact that they have the letters of the alphabet and a corresponding object inside makes them a great learning tool even for older tots  we have really enjoyed these and recommend them to our friends ","169":"awesume  best blocks ever   this toy was our grandson s favorite  so i just had to find it again for our newest grandchild  thank goodness for online shopping ","170":"keeps his attention  my little boy is just getting interested in these blocks  they are too cute  he s learning to manipulate the block in his hands  the little things inside the blocks are adorable  some spin  some twirl  some rock  a definate upgrade from the standard wooden blocks ","171":"great value   this set incorporates a lot of the favorites from other sets packaged in an a to z learning format  i have been leary of purchasing too many of these blocks for storage reasons so the zippered case is a great bonus  definitely worth every penny ","172":"wonderful but not worth  80   these are great blocks but they are definitely not worth the listed  79 99  they can be purchsed for about  20 many other places ","173":"worth the investment  this is a great set of blocks  i researched different blocks for some time and found these to be the most durable  age and developmentally appropriate  and highly educational   25 bucks may seem like a lot  but i think it is well worth it  i am very impressed with the quality the size and shape of the blocks is just right  my son is 5 months old and he is able to hold the blocks perfectly in his little hands  plus  the blocks do not have sharp corners  like the wooden blocks also available on this site  that could hurt your little one  especially those of you with chewers   one category that i rated this toy with only a 4  instead of 5  is the  fun  factor  for younger babies that may not  get it  yet  this toy may not be as fun for them until they are a little bit older  my son is not yet able to fully comprehend that there are even toys inside the blocks  but then again he is only 5 months  give him a couple of months and he ll really dig them ","174":"waste off money  this is not waterproof its garbage where batteries go in broke while trying to adj do not buy you turn the end to control it that loosens the battery cover where water gets in so how is it waterproff     ","175":"california exotics waterproof delights blue ballsy  the california exotics waterproof delights blue ballsy is to spice up the relationship and it worked since the beginning my other half likes it ","176":"small didn t work  it is very small compared to what i thought it would be  but even so it didn t work when we got it","177":"makes for fascinating reading   whale naturalist and animal communicator mary getten goes beyond what other research has achieved in the way of whale study and communication processes  in 1991 she studied the j pod  a family of whales off washington state  her contention that they use direct telepathic communication between themselves and can do so with humans also makes for fascinating reading diane c  donovancalifornia bookwatch","178":"pretty nifty   i purchased these for a halloween party  and then   like a dummy  i forgot to put them up  nevertheless  i did hold them up around the house in search of a good place to hang them  they re pretty big and look really cool  i d say there s a little bit of educational value too  as you can teach your children about the actual pictures they re depicting  even though i forgot to hang them up  i really liked these scene setters and i ll be using them next year ","179":"yet another unsubstantiated case      while i believe in discrimination  i certainly can t believe what is in this book  it is an unsubstantiated smear campaign to rally the troups in higher ed to claw again for the preservation of academic freedom  a rally which falls flat ","180":"molly myers  molly myers  in her review of  my name is rachel corrie   describes the ism as  an organization dedicated to non violence   this is radical left wing propaganda  ism offices have regularly been used to hide terrorists and their weapons  ism  pacifists  regularly throw rocks at idf soldiers  and they re perfectly willing to use violence in order to sabotage the wall intended to keep  innocent palestinians  from murdering israelis so please disregard molly s reviews  they are biased in the extreme ","181":"gardening lawn book  four pages of the book was missing  it just happened to be the formulas that my husband needed  fortunately he was able to copy our friends book  but i will hesitate to buy another book like this again ","182":"it s a knock off   the official chrono trigger ost has 3 discs  this version has some of the major tracks on it  the audio quality is good  but caveat emptor  buyer beware  this is a chinese knock off oh and if you buy the 3 disc version  make sure the cover does not have a green and red logo reading  fx   for this is also a counterfeit  the serial numbers on the real soundtrack cds are pscn 5021  pscn 5022  and pscn 5023 ","183":"just a few   these are the handful of tracks we hear over and over again  it s far from complete though missing such memorable tracks as  sealed door    wings across time  or  at the bottom of the night  it doesn t have a single battle theme accept the final boss hell this doesn t even have lucca s theme and she s on the cover had i seen a track list beforehand i wouldn t have bought this i blame my self for not being more curious of the number of cd s i m sorry i paid  35 dollars american for this travesty  may lavos have mercy on my soul save your selves and your money  while you still can ","184":"it was  ok  but i won t watch it again  i watched this last night  and i don t remember enough of it to give it a indepth review  but it wasn t as bad as people are letting on nor was it as great as people are letting on  if you don t like your killer to be supernatural then don t bother with this  its about a guy that comes back from the dead  his whole storyline is kinda silly and there are plot holes all over the place  the acting wasn t bad at all  and neither were the deaths  in fact it was kinda gory  but that doesn t make a great movie  the flashbacks were a little confusing as well  i wouldn t watch it again  but its far from the worst movie i ve seen ","185":"loved it   p s  stephen colletti is so hot    i initially bought the movie just because stephen colletti  who i m in love with  was one of the leads   and i really didn t expect much from what looks to be a low budget indie horror flick  but  i really did like it  the lead girl who plays jennifer  nikki deloach  is really good  i can t believe i ve never seen her in anything before  maybe i have  but i didn t know    it was cool to see the guy from weekend at bernie s  terry kiser    he is a really good actor  too bad he was dead the whole time in both movies i saw him in  lol  anyways  this was a cool movie and i m glad i got it ","186":"mask maker  it was good horrifying never a dull moment u can watch and not be bored ir wondering when is a good part coming","187":"mask maker  i liked the film it has what every horror likes in this type of movie the suspense mystery good and bad times plus a shocking ending that makes you think that there is more to story  and plot was very good robert ","188":"not the worst american b movie  this movie was a horror film thhat displayed an effort to steer clear of typical horror movie dialogue and pacing  there are no blonde girls and the girls that are here don t trip over the tree roots in the yard  now a white girl did fall and twist her knee in the movie but guess what  it was not on a tree root   ","189":"mask of familiarity  mask maker takes us down a cinematic path often traveled and does it in a typically predictable fashion  a story of revenge with an unstoppable killer who murders his victims and uses their skinned faces to achieve some kind of beauty  flashbacks reveal his motivation in an attempt to elicit some level of sympathy mask maker isn t the worst entry in this familiar territory but it doesn t tread new waters either  the cast performs on various levels of competence  weekend at bernie s terry kiser is an effective guilt ridden buffoon  treat williams is ill used in a cameo role  horror vet michael berryman is unusually restrained in a small role  nikki deloach is no jamie lee curtis in her leading role  giving a weak performance in a typical survivor role as the resilient resourceful female  doomed fiance stephen colletti  sic  is equally flaccid an open ended finale paves the way for mask maker ii   something we definitely don t need ","190":"unmasked                    sadly  there is absolutely nothing original in this movie  the filmmakers shamelessly borrowed from practically everyone  turning out a stale formula piece that is purely by the numbers  i couldn t find a thing that elevated this movie above a 100 other like films  the plot is standard  a group of kids spend the weekend at an old house with a bad history  a standard  run of the mill maniac kills them in unimaginative ways and of course no one notices until it s too late  everything happens exactly on cue  in order  with no surprises  and no frights  this movie is safe and boring  it really couldn t have been any better if it tried  not even the brief appearance of horror icon michael berryman  playing a nice guy for a change  can help the dullness of the script even the title is a misnomer  although the original title  maskerade  isn t any better and i had such high hopes as this is one of my favorite genres ","191":"a museum exhibit inside a book  this book was in my library s genealogy section  and you re not allowed to take genealogy books out of the library  but i liked it enough to sit in the library and read it  in two sittings this a quick read  because it has loads of pictures  photos of the ghetto and its inhabitants  and also pictures of artifacts such as ration cards  work certificates  yellow stars  etc  it s more like a museum exhibit than a simple book  because of the format i think young people would be able to get something out of the book too  although it is clearly written for adults  certainly it probably has the most information on the kovno kaunas ghetto all in one place both researchers and the ordinary person interested in the holocaust would enjoy this bonus  pages from the diary of ilya gerber are printed in this book  you can read extracts from the diary in alexandra zapruder ssalvaged pages  young writers  diaries of the holocaust ","192":"great resource for chinese eastern medincine  this is an excellent book to have as a reference fo eastern methodologies in medicine and healing  unfortunately it is long out of print  but if you can get your hands on a copy of this text  you will not be dissappointed  in fact  if you are unhappy with it  i will be happy to purchase it from you as i have many peers that would happily use it ","193":"why is this a good book   as someone who has been practicing chinese medicine for 16 years in san diego  www bodymindwellnesscenter com   i find this book an excellent resource for anyone who wants and in dept primer into the theoretical basis and practical application of a system of medicine that originates in the chinese philosophy that emphasizes the natural balance found in nature and agriculture ","194":"a book that is worth a second look  this book is great  it is very informative  it is easy to read and understand and has alot of pictures  i would recommend this book for any one wanting to learn about chinese medicine ","195":"best game ever  this games makes even amazing games like starcraft and warcraft redundant  warhammer has it all and does it better than anyone else  truly great game  total fun  great combat  graphics  races  units  a pleasure to play ","196":"guitar in absentia  with all due respect to ambient music enthusiasts  i was really disappointed that there was no guitar work whatsoever on this album  hillage fans of l and fish rising be forewarned steve hillage was a pretty darn good guitarist  maybe l was his showcase with members of todd rundgren s utopia backing him up noting that other reviewers have rated this highly  i will give it another listen  however  i am dissapointed in the direction steve has taken his music ","197":"stiff and smells like drying paint  you get what you pay for  this pillow is stiff and smelled like drying paint for 4 days  i thought i was getting a non name brand version of the temperpedic pillow  i bought the real pillow for my mother years ago and paid many times the price  this thing doesn t even come close ","198":"review of pillow  this was a joke  i am sending the pillow back  does not come close to what was advertised  i believe the cardboard box that it arrived in would have been softer under my head  i am giving it one star just so i can post this  i only wish the stars could go negative ","199":"don t bother  the
